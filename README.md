# Guess-the-number
We have to guess the number that computer has selected
The game starts with range 0-100 by default where you will be given 7 chances to predict the number computer has choosen.
Then after the game is done it continues with range 0-100 as a new game.
You can however change it to 0-1000 where you will be given 10 chances and when game is done you will continue with new game 
with range 0-1000 again until you change it to 0-100.

The code runs in codeskulptor which is an interactive web-based Python programming environment
